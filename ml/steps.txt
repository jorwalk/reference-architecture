Step 1: Define the problem
Identify what your problem is and how you can apply machine learning to solve it.

Step 2: Create an evaluation strategy
Think about what the evaluation metrics will be in your machine learning model. You will be able to keep track of how the model is performing and how you can improve it.

Step 3: Prepare your data
The data you’ve collected needs to be cleaned, formatted, combined, sampled and what not. In other words: it needs to be processed.

Step 4: Validate your data
Start with a simple profiling process to help eliminate mistakes.

Step 5: Build a model
Based on the results you’re looking for, the type of analysis you want to run needs to be determined and a predictive model needs to be selected and built.

Step 6: Improve over time
Get more data, reframe the problem you’re aiming to solve and tune your algorithm to get better results.
