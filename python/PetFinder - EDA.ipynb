    "## Topic Modeling with Scikit Learn\n",
    "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a algorithms used to discover the topics that are present in a corpus. A few open source libraries exist, but if you are using Python then the main contender is Gensim. Gensim is an awesome library and scales really well to large text corpuses. Gensim, however does not include Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), which can also be used to find topics in text. The mathematical basis underpinning NMF is quite different from LDA. I have found it interesting to compare the results of both of the algorithms and have found that NMF sometimes produces more meaningful topics for smaller datasets. NMF has been included in Scikit Learn for quite a while but LDA has only recently (late 2015) been included. The great thing about using Scikit Learn is that it brings API consistency which makes it almost trivial to perform Topic Modeling using both LDA and NMF. Scikit Learn also includes seeding options for NMF which greatly helps with algorithm convergence and offers both online and batch variants of LDA."
